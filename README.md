Welcome to my MPC Practice repository. Here, I will be writing codes for various kinds of MPC for Autonomous Ground and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.The
following are some of my goals:-
1. Lane Manoeuvre using Linear Unconstrained Model Predictive Control (**Done**)
2. Path Tracking using Linear Parameter Varying Model Predictive Control with Constraints (LPV-MPC)
3. Combining Lane Manoeuvre with Trajectory Planning in a Dynamic Environment usinng Frenet Frame Method.
4. Applying LPV-MPC in a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (Preferably, Quadcopter)
